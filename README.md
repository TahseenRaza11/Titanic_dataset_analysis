# 🚢 Titanic Dataset Analysis (Seaborn)

This repository presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the **Titanic dataset** using Python and Seaborn. The Titanic dataset is a classic machine learning dataset that provides information on the passengers aboard the ill-fated Titanic ship. The goal of this project is to extract meaningful insights about survival patterns using data visualization and statistical analysis.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The Titanic dataset contains the following key features:

- `survived`: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- `pclass`: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- `sex`: Gender of the passenger
- `age`: Age of the passenger
- `sibsp`: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- `parch`: Number of parents/children aboard
- `fare`: Ticket fare
- `embarked`: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
- `class`, `who`, `deck`, `embark_town`, etc. (Seaborn-enhanced features)

## ✅ Tasks Performed

- **Data Loading**: Loaded Titanic dataset using Seaborn’s built-in `load_dataset()` function.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, dropped irrelevant columns, and transformed features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Distribution of survival by gender, class, and age
  - Analysis of fare distribution and passenger class
  - Visualization of survival rates using bar plots, count plots, and histograms
  - Insights into embarkation points, family size impact, and age groups

## 📊 Visualizations Used

- Bar plots
- Count plots
- Histograms
- Box plots
- Heatmaps (correlation matrix)

## 📚 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Seaborn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Conclusion

This analysis provided valuable insights into passenger survival patterns on the Titanic. By visualizing relationships among features such as age, gender, and class, we gained a better understanding of the social dynamics and critical factors influencing survival.
